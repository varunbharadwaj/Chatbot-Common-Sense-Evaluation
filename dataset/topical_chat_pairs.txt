I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures.__eou__Well the universe is made up of planets right. So the bigger planets suck the smaller ones in and consume them.__eou__
I like Bill Murray but I can't agree that Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of modern comedy.__eou__Is Kung Fu Hustle a movie? If so, I've never seen it.__eou__

The Virginia House trying to expand medicare using Trump and Pence is an odd occurance__eou__I agree. House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) contends that expanding the federal-state health-care program during the Trump administration offers the "best chance for conservative reforms."__eou__

Good Morning! I'm not much interested in the White House, but I do root for President Trump__eou__So do I.  I hope he succeeds with some of his initiatives.  I wonder if he'll want to take the solar panels off the back of the white house that George Bush had installed.__eou__
How do you feel about boarder security and the fact families are being separated at the boarder?__eou__That is a difficult issue since mistreatment of children is sad and may be comparable to what happened in Nazi concentration camps when you see that  2000 kids were taken from their families __eou__

Hi! Can you believe the three wealthiest presidents of all time were Jefferson, Washington and JFK?__eou__Hi! Washington and jFK makes sense, this is probably a bit out of date (i.e., Trump). The president of indonesia released 3 pop albums in office. Multi talented!__eou__

There are so very odd facts about the united states government. I wonder if the same can be said for other countries. __eou__I'm sure there is. I find it odd that every US president with a beard has been Republican. __eou__
Hello! Do you have a favorite football team?__eou__hi, how are you? no i dont. i dont really know the sport well. You?__eou__
Hi!  Do you follow the government?__eou__A little the Republican party is also called the GOP.__eou__

Have you heard that Trump is apparently worried over the Manafort trial? It's been in the news lately.__eou__Yeah, Paul Manafort is quite the character, as is Trump. Trump was evidently quoted saying he didn't understand why the government didn't tell him Manafort was under investigation.__eou__
What do you think about the company Trump keeps like Paul manafort?__eou__I think it is questionable.  Obviously the problem is two-fold for Trump.  The types he associates with and when he endorses someone, that stamp of approval does not mean much.__eou__
Hi! Are you a football fan?__eou__I watch some football on occasion.__eou__
Hi! Do you follow the government at all? I find it awfully ironic that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy them. Ha!__eou__I've always followed the government closely.

do you know much about presidents?__eou__I know some stuff. DO you know who are the three wealthiest us presidents?__eou__
Do you get a lot of news from the media?__eou__I try to stick with larger media outlets.  I follow news aggregators, like Drudge and then for issues I am interested, I get info from different sources to weed out biases.  Media is still important but needs to report more and opine less.  I think that's the gist of the Gallup poll.  Your thoughts?__eou__
Episcopal High School is great for learning football and bonding as a team.  It is very diverse as well.__eou__Yeah I heard it is a good school.  I guess the student population there is 445. __eou__

Hilarious that Fox News tried to sue the Simpsons for parodying it. I suppose Ailes didn't understand the Streisand Effect, perhaps due to the fact that he's an older guy and not super familiar with the internet. __eou__Not a huge fan of Fox News.

This isn't journalism, it's amateur hour...__eou__I agree with you on that.  They hate him and it shows every time they open their mouth.  It's actually kind of funny to watch them.__eou__
