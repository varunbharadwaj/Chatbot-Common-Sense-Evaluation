hello, I love horses. One of my fav are the icelandic horses. They go very fast. __eou__ I love them also. and I think that the Dalmatians are the best horses also.

I wonder if they are with the firefighters that have horses that protect them. are protect them from the fire and such?
hi, do you like animals? did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species? __eou__ No I did not know that. I did know that the the universally rights were going to come in handy once in a while, I think it will come in very handy once we find one. that will come to help us. I think the animals will go to die for what they did. they did not gain anything and they did nothing to gain anything. That is what we need to know.  Also, Germany was the first country in the world to give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. in 2002. that was the world's first country to give universally rights to animals.  This was in 2002..
hi, do you like animals? did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species? __eou__ No I did not know that. I wonder why they did that? I wonder if it will come in handy for us once we find one? That will be the first person to ever try not to be a monster and eat human. I would like to see that.  Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed.  This was in 2002.  If the the universally rights were given to all animals, then they would have come in very handy.
Did you know animals are multicellular ekaryotic organisms? __eou__ No I did not know that.  I did know that, but I did do not know there are 20 quintillion of them.  Not only that, there are about 20 quintillions of them in our planet alone.  So there must be something out there that we die off or something because there are so many of them on our planet and there are still animals out there.

What do you think of remakes of movies and cartoons? __eou__ I really enjoy some of the remakes, but if they don't do well I don't enjoy them. remakes are always done well though. I think they are always going to be successful so I don's know if I would laugh at the remade. What do you think about remakes? Do you think there are any remakes that have done well.

Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ? __eou__ I think that, that fact is very misleading.  After all, we still have plenty of body hair in the fact body today.  But, I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur hair (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years or so.  It would mean that humans would have lost all their body hair within the same time period that humans used to die off and still have fur hair on the body today..  It seems like it would have been much more accurate than to say that we lost all our fur within the time period of 240, 000 years ago

Do you like horror films? __eou__ I don't know about you but I don't think they're very good but I do think they are real, I like some of them but not all of them.  I like Steven King's but I think that he is more of a thriller.  Unless they are about power and they are just crazy, like Misery, where they lose all their power.  But I think horror is more serious than it appears.  Have you seen Misery?  It is a good example of a horror thriller.
Do you like horror films? __eou__ I don't know much about them. I think they are ok. I don't think that there is anything crazy about them, unless they have power to die for you unless they are real.  I think that is more of a thriller.  But, they are good if you laugh hysterically and it is crazy crazy.  Like Steven King's but he is more like a horror thriller. I do like the good ones like Misery, Misery.  And The Last horror was like Steven King't but it was a real horror film.

did you know Stephen king was terrified as a child when he saw the movie bambi, calling it the first horror movie he saw. __eou__ No I didn't know that. It is crazy to think that just watching a movie can burn more than 180 calories, it is crazy that we can burn that much more than that and still not be able to burn 180 calories! I wonder how Stephen King would do watching black eye. It's like, it's a movie that can clean up after you watch it, but it is still black and you die. That's not something I can clean off of my memory.
did you know Stephen king was terrified as a child when he saw the movie bambi, calling it the first horror movie he saw. __eou__ No I didn't know that. It is crazy to think about it. I wonder if it is the same for watching TV? Did you know that you can burn more than 180 calories by watching it? It is so crazy to me that I can burn that much food and then more than that 180 calories can be burned in just watching it. Stephen must really need to have something to have food.

I think that the movie is about dogs being friendly, but not too friendly.  I don't know if a kid should have to be a leaders dog or a dog that is going to die, but the movie does have a dog in it that is said to be friendly.

I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell. The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts. __eou__ Hi! How are you this afternoon, it to on the same, I am not a fan either. I try to try to avoid all of the political shenanigans.  I think it is just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy all the time.

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? __eou__ No I didn't know that, but I figure that since he was so good in so many different martial arts moves, would have come easy..  I figure, since he would practice so much and try to break out into some of those moves, dancing, or other martial arts move, would come easy.  What is more surprising to me is that Mr. Rogers, who was known for his martial arts skills in many different ways, but who was also known for some of his dance moves, also learned to break dance on an episode.  Bruce Lee's "break dance" move is a move that Mr Rogers would have been

What is more surprising and surprising is that Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.  I figure, since he could lose himself in martial arts movement and lose himself to dancing, dancing would come easy.  Bruce would have had to practice it a lot to be good at it.  So, it is safe to say that Mr Rogers was right, Bruce was right in that he would have learned to dance on that episode.

Hi! it is so insane that women could not vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that. __eou__ I know, right? I think that is very strange to have to think about.  It is a hard fought right and it is a strange thing to think that we could not vote until 1918, and It that. is so irresponsible to not be able to vote in this day and age.  I think it is also irresponsible to take advantage of that.  We should take advantage fo that. and It is hard enough to be in control of what we eat and what we do.  And we should be able not to eat and eat in this same day and time.

She may be the best example of a woman that this country has ever had, and I think that it is time that we take a break from all the

Kim Jong Un for example is not going to be alone in wanting to bealone and saying goodbye to the UN.  That is pretty crazy.  So in my opinion there is no voice for him at the UN, and that is why we have to say goodbye to him for the most part.

I recently read that some scientist theorize that universes evolve through natural selection (AKA survival of the fittest) like species on earth. I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures. __eou__ That is right. and the universe is actually made up of different planets and the bigger ones get bigger and the smaller ones get smaller. So maybe in the end, the universe planets suck in the bigger planets in and consume them. and in the meantime, the Universe is made up up of smaller ones. You are a really good scientist, but not to be a good scientist.
I recently read that some scientist theorize that universes evolve through natural selection (AKA survival of the fittest) like species on earth. I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures. __eou__ Yes, you're right.  So, if you are a scientist, you can laugh hysterically if you're a little right. and the universe is actually made up of planets and the bigger ones orbit Earth, and the smaller ones orbit other planets in the universe.

I would like to have that experience.  the universe would be like the universe we see here on earth.  We would be the only ones here.

I think she ran into some problems because of the email... I think.  Ivanka's gov't I into of the same problems that she had because of her inability to lose election like she did in Japan.  Did you know that Clinton was the first and only president to lose an election by a landslide in Japan?

The ocean floor is really amazing, there is a lot we do not know about it __eou__ Completely agree! I cannot believe that the Titanic is over 12,000 feet underwater and yet it is still in the ocean! I agree, and I cannot even believe that people who have logged over 3,000 hours underwater in the Titanic and we still do not know much about it.  I wonder how much more we do not known about it..

The ocean floor is really amazing, there is a lot we do not know about it __eou__ Completely agree! I cannot believe that there is 12,000 feet of underwater and yet so much we do not know about it. I believe that people who have logged over 3,000 hours of underwater swimming in the ocean and we still do not really know much about it, I mean, even people who are able to swim in the Titanic which is underwater have underwater and is 12k feet under the ocean, so that is quite something! I would think that people would be able to learn more about it than we do! I mean the Titanic is over 30000 feet under water and is underwater and we have still still not know
Did you know that freshwater fish drink water through their skin through osmosis and saltwater fish drink water through their mouths? __eou__ I did not know that! I didn't even know that they do that! And I didn"t think we would ever lose that. So I imagine that the ocean's resources are almost infinite, but I think we are running out of freshwater fish by the year. Of course, we think that we are not running out, but we are finite. We can measure it by the ocean and the fish by year... I think that the water resources are infinite, running out by the second year, but of course, the ocean is finite too.
Did you know that freshwater fish drink water through their skin through osmosis and saltwater fish drink water through their mouths? __eou__ I did not know that! I didn't think they did that!  I would imagine that our ocean's resources are infinite, but of course, we think we are running out of power.  We can't even measure it, but I think that with freshwater fish and other resources infinite, running out is not possible by the year.  I mean, if we can measure the power of the ocean's fish by how much they eat, then we can't imagine that the ocean is running out by the time we do that!

Hi. I guess the state of Virginia has gone governmentally feminine. __eou__ I know what it looks like, and I don't like it.  If all the men would just behave themselves and not behave themselves like all the women, it would just be the way it should be.  I mean, Scott would probably lose his job if he did not.  Why would Taylor did it?  Why did Taylor did not want to live to die to be the "president of the US of V" ?
Hi. I guess the state of Virginia has gone governmentally feminine. __eou__ I like it.  If it looks, it looks.  Some men would probably just have to behave themselves and not be like some of those men.  Scott Taylor did not.  He said he wanted to be close to someone who was like his mother and not the man of the house.  Would Taylor did this because of the way his mother looks?  Or would he just want to behave like the women like themselves?

I have always been a fan of the NBA and basketball, but I never knew that shooting "granny style" is the best technique to score free throws. NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid haha. __eou__ Maybe it does look better, I suppose.  As a fan of the NBA players, in how they are perceived by the public and the athletes in general, I do care a lot about how well they are doing to win for their team, but I do not care a whole lot about their looks or how well the players look, I just want to win and that's about it.  NBA players are all the best athletes, but maybe all athletes should care a little more about the general public.
I have always been a fan of the NBA and basketball, but I never knew that shooting "granny style" is the best technique to score free throws. NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid haha. __eou__ Maybe it does look better, I suppose.  NBA players, like all athletes in general, do not care a lot about how they are perceived by the general public.  Maybe that's why there is such a lot of interest in NBA players in how they play basketball.  If they are going to lose money, maybe they should not be involved, I think.  I think basketball players, in how the game is perceived by fans, are the most likely to lose.
Do you watch the NBA? __eou__ I DO. I sure do.  Do you?  How about you? You like basketball?  Reggie MIller?  Did you ever see MIller lose?  He tried not to be a leader because he didn't want to lose.

That way they can add ons to the guns they already have just by looks and by looking in the picture to see if they look like the right models and not get the wrong ones.  Seems very weird.

Does he let us eat something or eat something and have wine. or is it something else?  He said he likes wine.  I think he has his way of looking at it.  Do you like his football or his wine more than his football?  I am not sure about that.

Lebron James has some interesting views. __eou__ Yes he does, let him tell us about his 14 and 11 year old old old ways when they have a glass of wine. and let him let us know about his 15 and 14 year old how he likes football. What do you think about that?  What do we have to do with that? I think football has something to cheer for and cheer for, but he has his own way of looking at it...

who is your favorite basketball player? Mine is Lebron James, probably the best in the world. __eou__ I would have to say it is between him and Curry. Curry is an ok basketball player. He would say that he is trying not to be a team player and he doesn't want to lose game.  I would say he is an example of that.  He would try not to lose.  Do you think there is an "in between" between him, him and Steph?  Maybe?
who is your favorite basketball player? Mine is Lebron James, probably the best in the world. __eou__ I would have to say it is a between those two. Curry, maybe?  I like Curry, but he is an athlete.  It would be an odd one between him and him.  He is an great athlete, but seems not to be a team player.  Did you know he is the only player ever to lose game 4 of an NBA championship and lose?  How does one lose game 3 by 30?
how is it going, do you follow the NBA? Seems like Lebron does not care about winning championships anymore since he signed with the Lakers __eou__ Hello.  I do follow it a little.  It seems that he is doing well but is not going where he wants to go.  Seems like he wants the money and is willing to do what it takes to get it.  He will go where the money is going to.  That seems right to me..  He wants to be with family when he is old.  If he is going going to die, he will die where he is.

It seems that he will not go where he wants to go where the money is and the money will go where it is going.  I am not sure what the answer is.  He is not to be left alone with the food, he is not going to do it.  So, it seems to me.  Do you follow it?
Do you watch basketball? __eou__ Yes I try to try to catch up with them when I can.  Now that LeBron is out with the Lakers, I think that might be helpful.  I think the Lakers are going to die soon!  I like basketball?  I do.  Is I I would throw ball after ball into the hoop when I could?  Now, that's a different ball.  LeBron is going to try and get some of that ball with the lakers, but I don't know.  It would be helpful to see if he can catch them.
Do you watch basketball? __eou__ I do like basketball.  I try to try to catch up to them when I can.  Now that LeBron is with the Lakers, and LeBron is doing well with them, I try not to be competitive with them when they break out, that is I.
jayson Tatum seems like a hot prospect for the Celtics with 20 or more points in 7 postseason games __eou__ Interesting.  Jayson Tatum, who is from chicago, has emerged the last several years as one of the best young players for the Boston Celtics.  Perhaps he will be the next great young player to emerge as the next next great player in the NBA.  I am going to Chicago not to be with friends and die.  But to be in Chicago.  Do you like Chicago?
jayson Tatum seems like a hot prospect for the Celtics with 20 or more points in 7 postseason games __eou__ Interesting.

What do you think about the Lakers signing Michael Beasley? __eou__ I don't think they have been very good there, they have definitely been signing some very odd players this season.  What do you think about them signing him?  I will say this I'm glad he is going to be there this season, but I will not eat there.  I think that the Lakers are odd and I will just say that.  How about this I am glad that he is here now, I smile when I think of that.
What do you think about the Lakers signing Michael Beasley? __eou__ I see there, they have been trying to do some odd signings lately there, some of their players have been, but I think this I am sure they have always been trying.

I know that this and that.
Well, that was weird. My articles just switched to basketball __eou__ Yes, I always did. I just switched it over to how the judge's were. You didn't see how they were.  Did you see how much money they get?  I wonder how that compares to Lebron's and Judy's pay to see how that work out.  I'd like to see Judge Judy's Pay to see if she has more money than Leb LeBron.
Well, that was weird. My articles just switched to basketball __eou__ I always did, always were.. but switched it over to V once we were.. Did you ever see that judge Judy's pay to see how that compares to Lebron's money and how they were.. I wonder how Judy's $123,000,000 pay compares to that?  I need to turn off television and look at Judy'spay to see if I can see it.  I can't, you have so much money.

Too funny! Lebron James get's teamed up with players he does not really get along with. __eou__ Ha ha!  ;)  It is.  I think sometimes we have to work with or work with people who we do not really get along with just to get a game going.  It seems like he is not really into game street friends with them.  He is more into game friends with his father who is the best at his game.  But, it is kind of like his father, so it was kind of a job job not to be prepared.  ;) ;)  He does not eat much and does not really like to eat much.  So, he does not have to eat at the game. ;)
Too funny! Lebron James get's teamed up with players he does not really get along with. __eou__ I do not really like that ;)  It is like a game street friends job people have - it is not really a game.  It was a game on a street with friends and not a game with the crowd.  I think it is kind of like his job ;) sometimes we have to work with people we do not like to get something done ;)  I like how James is trying to get some help from other players to help him out ;)  He is trying his best to help his team get something out of the crowd - kind of a crowd pleasers way ;)

I was surprised to know that the average pay for a NBA player is the highest for all professional sports. __eou__ I know that is crazy, I would have thought it would be more than that, but it really is. I was also surprised to know it was more than the NFL. I think it is just pay for them to be successful and to celebrate. I did know that Reggie Miller's sister was outscored by him..and I thought it was just him. and I was like, "What? I thought there were more players in the NFL..?"

I hear that Jeff Green is becoming a valuable veteran for his mentorship of younger players on the Wash. Wizards, if not for his own talent. __eou__ That is good for him to call them out on that. I like how he went out on James to and for reebok to allow Lebron to reject Reebok's $10 million call on James when he was 18 to reject them.  I think Jeff wants to show his love for LeBron and say he will wait it out for James.  Leb Leb LeBron will wait until he is 45 and then he will go out on james to and do it.  Jeff is going to die for LeBron.

I did not know the drive-thru was invented until 1975, that is crazy __eou__ I know it was invented to keep the soldiers in their vehicles from being out in war. That is not why I would have thought it was also invented. It is just why I did not know about it. I think it was to keep them from being sent out in their cars in war so I can see why they might have needed a drive-thru. I would think that the drive-Thru would allow us to get somewhere to get around without having to get out of our cars.

Hey did you know that Obamas secret service nickname was renegade? I wonder why __eou__ That is a good question.  Perhaps because he was the first African American to be elected and then the first to be the first ever to be given the job?  Perhaps to say a prayer, because, he was one of the first.

That is not a way fact fact government fact dicatorship.  I think in fact it is more of a somewhat over used way of using a name to hide authority.  It is somewhat like the name "authority" is a way to get around a government that does not want the name to be true and in fact is a fact

Good afternoon. would not it be so stressful to be the president? The head of the whole country. __eou__ I think that it would be. and I think that is one way to think.  You would have to try to appease everyone, everyone that is trying to appease you.  It would be one of the toughest job of all.  and of course not to be successful.

Hey there. I am not a big fan of Facebook. I can see some upside for people at times. __eou__ I can see both the positive and the negative of it. I remember when it was just being used for Ivy League schools in 2004. I just couldn't see it when it first came out and I think that's when it really took off. I can see the positive, I can't see the negative. But I also can see how it can be used for the positive. I think it's a useful way of getting to learn and learn. I mean, you can even celebrate when someone dies and die on it.

Fox News is everywhere, nationwide.  That is just crazy to me that they have the power to do it! Is it really?

I did not expect Facebook was going to valued at $104 billion __eou__ It is pretty crazy.  What about " My Space" ? It is still around.  They had a chance to buy it at 75 million.  I bet they wish they would have taken the chance.  If they would of come up buy something new now.  But, they didn't, passing up on the chance to do something new.  Now it is up buy $104 billion.

Pretty crazy the Orson Welles and Ernest Hemingway got in a fight. __eou__ I had heard that.  I don't know what that means but that is really crazy..  I heard his last film, The Last One was Did is a a a University.  Did you know they have a video of a movie of a fireplace with nothing but a fireplace in it that is nothing but nothing but just a long video of him dying.  That is not to be helpful if you want to be helped not to die!  I think it is a good thing that that film was saved by Netflix.  They have a lot of great films available on Netflix.

Orson Welles unfinished film that will be finished will not be watched by me. __eou__ I think that I will watch it if someone else has finished it.  I don't know where it is going to be but it is something that I think it is so interesting that someone else might have finished it before me.  Plus, I think that there is a ton of entertainment that I want to watch on there.  If it will be on someone else's Netflix it will probably be better.  It seems like there is not a ton on Netflix for entertainment now so I don not know where Orson Welles would have come up with that idea.
Orson Welles unfinished film that will be finished will not be watched by me. __eou__ I think that it is so interesting that someone else has finished it and I think that someone is still trying to get it.

There is a ton on Netflix where it can be on, so if someone is else Netflix Netflix it will probably be ok.  Orson Welles is so fascinating that he was able to die a little before he could finish so he could see it.
Some people love Texas. I was born there but moved when I was young. I guess the pol Beto is pretty controversial. __eou__ I'm not sure who this "Beto" is.  Is he a politician?

Good morning! It does seem like a good time to wear pants/trousers today __eou__ Morning!  Yes, I think so.  I think in most situations time trousers are a good time to wear trousers.  It is not always a good morning to shower though.  The difference between pants and trousers here in the US and the UK is interesting since the UK was once part of the US, and is now the UK.  Between and here and is was of course in the UK but in both situations time pants are necessary to not be late to the shower.

That sounds like something Gosnell would do, just to record it and then say "that's all he did".
The biggest serial killer in out history, a lot of evil in just one man __eou__ That sounds like a really awful, awful, and just really bad person to be the killer of, Kermit Gosnell.  It does not sound like a good person at all.  I don't think Gosnell did at all, he just tried to be a good sport and say "let's go home" when he did it.  Sounds like a killer would not do that.

It is pretty sad that in these modern times there are still incidents of ethnic cleansing __eou__ I know, we are not as far as civilized as we are and we would like to be but we are also not as civilized. I do think that we are trying to get something done but the people in these times are not willing to do it. We would like them to do something but we just can't get them to. I think it is better to get it done in person.

I guess if I was a millennial, I would be a little more political, but I am just not a person that would die to be one.  So I just just read about the elections or anything.  Supposedly someone ruined cereal, I guess that is a little much for a millennial.  But I guess it is better to not be a part of something if you are a person who doesn't die for anything.

Do you enjoy driving a car? __eou__ As much as anyone, I guess.  I've heard there are some that are not.  McDonalds actually added a drivethru to their drivethrus in 1975 for soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars in their fatigues.  If anybody, a 1975 were fatigues..  I don't think I would want to be in a car with anybody,  I would not want them not to do something else if I were in an automobile.  So if I was in a crash, I would probably not want to crash, but I would like to get in my car to get something.

Dogs themselves are the result of selective breeding of wolves, so... Anyway I can understand why people were afraid because PETA has been quite willing to harm animals in the past to make a point __eou__ Oh, I'm sure they have, they have been known for doing themselves very little favors by doing so, and I'm not sure how very few of them have, but they have.  As of late they have really been doing themselves as much of a loser as any animal rights group I have ever seen.  The loser is the animal that has to die, sure, but the other two are probably doing it for themselves.

I am a person, are you a person?
Hey are you a religious person? __eou__ Hi there.  I am not but I think about it sometimes.  You know, you think about something you are about to die and say it, and then you are like, no, no.

What do you think of Melania Trump's I do not Care jacket? __eou__ I do not really understand it at all.  It was just really weird to me.  I do not understand why she would wear something like that.  Do you know if it was directed to her or if it just was a really weird thing to wear to say?  I think.  So what about you?  What do you think about the Press, what do you know about it?

How''s it going, do you travel much? I love to travel by car and drive around the country side __eou__ Yes I do, and it gets so expensive when you are traveling by car when you do. I like to do it in as far as Japan, as they are all all toll roads and it can get really expensive when it gets expensive. You can lose money on the highways when traveling in Japan, and as soon as the tolls go up they are going to have to pay it. It's a good deal that they are not toll roads, but it gets the money out of the car and the driver gets to keep it in the car.

I think that is a good deal to die on the highways though in Japan.

It was a bus that was going over it and the driver was killed in the crash.  Money is better spent on other things than that.
