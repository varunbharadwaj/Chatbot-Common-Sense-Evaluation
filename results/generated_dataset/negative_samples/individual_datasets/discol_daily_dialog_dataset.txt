This house is not looking all that great from here __eou__ You really can't tell me anything about a house that you really can tell me, really. I know a lot about the outside of a house from what I've seen from the outside but I just cannot tell you about the inside. I can tell you this though, if we let you go inside the house, it needs to be tidy or we will die. I cannot let you in the house. If you do not let us in the HOUSE, then everything house outside is going to die.
This house is not looking all that great from here __eou__ Really, I really can't tell you anything about it. I just know that I cannot really tell you what everything about it is. I do know that the house is on fire from the outside. They will not let us go inside the house though. There is a fire in a house on the outside of the house so it will not be included in the house. I think that everything house outside of that house must not be including the house inside.

Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house ! __eou__ I know it is a bit fixer-upper look but the outside of it is ok, and they let us take a look inside and you can see that it is, but it is just a bit of a bit.  It is a little bit fixed-up.  I have never seen a house where it is useless to go in, but they close it up and close it off and say "you must break finger" or "you will need help" when you go inside.  They let us in to take a peek at the inside and it is not a fixerupper.

I don't know if they are dating each other or what, but they are definitely not just plain old dating each others face.  Leo has the same wrinkle on his nose as you.

It is like you said, they are together for a while, so maybe it is just a date.  But

Our neighbour's tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I have made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ That would be the best way to go.  You would cut the electricity off right to spite them.  I would be trying to break your nose face to face with your nose.  That is not to be heard.

Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I did not mean to be mean to her but I did not want to be in a situation where I did Not want to like her and keep butting in where she was butting me.

When I quarrel with my husband . He did not even try to cool me out . __eou__ Yes, it takes two, to make sure that they quarrel and do not ejaculate.

It takes two for a family of three to make a family.
You are blue in the face , arn't you ? __eou__ Yes I am blue in the face as well. My cat, the cat fish, has eaten through my face, and has eaten all of my fish.

He will be settled in and when he gets a job everything will be better for him , and he will not want to be around his other sibling, he does not want his best friend to lose his bestfriend to someone else.  So he is going to have to get his own job.
I did not like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . __eou__ Maybe, he is just trying to help him to find a job, he has been trying for one since he was 18 , so everything will be settled soon. When he finds a job everything will all be fine, he will be able to find himself a job.  My brother's want everything to be perfect and they always want the money, but they are always looking for the next one.  I do not like the way he is going about it, he does not seem to be settling down.  He is always trying to get a new job.

She has been on edge since the very first day of the match up since she said she was going to wear dress up and was going out to go out to wear a dress.  I am trying to bug myself not to help Jane out by saying the bug and the edge match up are over since they are over.  But I am not going to be able to help her out with that.  We will have to see.  It is not over yet.  So I am going to let you go now.  Thanks for asking.
You seem to have all the jitters about Jane . __eou__ Yes I am, I am sure she is on the edge of her mind since I am the one on the verge of the edge, she says that she was going to try out for the match but she is not sure if she can do it.

If not to get something done there and then there is too much bad food in Germany and too much food in the US not to getting something done.  . . . I think we need a lotProgress there.
I do not understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ Parents are just trying to be a success for their daughter.  Li Na's mother has been building a building that is under fire under her own name since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Chinese Canadian man and she is almost driving the building down.  It is crazy to think that a Chinese woman got married to a Canadian man.  But she is crazy.  I think Li Na is crazy for driving.  She is crazy, and her parents are crazy.
I do not understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ I don't either.  Li Na's mother has been a little crazy.  She has been under a fire under her own building since she got married with her neighbour's daughter and got a house fire under it.  I think she is almost crazy too.

I know residents are getting up in arms about it but I just thought residents arms are up because they want to go home.  The plan does seem to be helpful but I don't really know what it is all about.  They say it is going to be useful and it's going to help the community so I think they should go for it.

Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Yes , it is.  I think most of the maple leaves have turned red here, though the maple trees here have turned most of them red, so it is not the most view you can get.  The maple leaves red because they have turned unreasonably red.  It is unreasonable for them to fall from tree to tree.  They fall to grind down the view.  But it is so beautiful to see them fall from the tree.

I think I need a new one . __eou__ I am not sure about that, there is an ad sale of a washing machine on there. I want to go see it to see what is it about.  I am not a big ad sale person.

You would think that I would be able to pay for the fire time.
Hurry up ! Time is money ! __eou__ Not!  You know, I would not be able to build a "fire under" under any of them, if I were to have a fire.  I know the importance of time and of money but not to buy things that will not be spend with it.   I think you are right.  It does not seem to me that there is a fire importance time and money.  But if you ask me, money is always money.

I think that it is not bad for kids to watch tv , but I feel that it can be bad for a person as well. I do not think it is bad for the kids to have fun with the violence as well, but that is just me. I would not want my kids to see it, or watch it, because it is too much, I think.

I think the Friendship competition is a better one than the Olympic competition, which is second best.  The Friendship competition second best is the death of one's self.  Thank goodness we can cheer for each other in Friendship competitions.  It seems so much better than the Olympics.  What do you think of the Olympic motto ' life is a friendship' ?  I like it .  I mean, I think that Friendship is better than death.
What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? __eou__ I don't know about it, but I think it is definitely a better name than ' higher , faster and stronger' , which is what they say.  I think that the Olympic motto is about competitiveness.  Friendship competition first , and the second is about "competitiveness".  Friendship is the best way to compete.  The Olympic motto ' higher, faster and strong' is about competition.  It seems to me that Friendship competition second is better than 'higher , faster, stronger' .  I don't like Friendship competition, though.
what is up , buddy ? You look so upset . __eou__ Just got broke up with a girl, she was the one I loved and I did not understand why she did not want to be with me but I just broke up. I just loved her and did not like her but she was a girl. Why did she have to lose game with a boy she liked? Why did I have to break up with her ? Why did a girl have to go not to be With Family and I had to lose that ? Why does she have a lose game and lose game ?
what is up , buddy ? You look so upset . __eou__ Just got broke up with a girl, I did not understand how she did not see that she loved me and did not want to have fun and just broke up.  Why did she not understand that I loved her and she was just a girl.  She is a girl?  Why?  I just want toHave fun with her buddy buddy!
A beautiful center ! __eou__ It was a good one, I have to say!  !  I think it is going to be a fire in the center of the shot,  I am going to have fun looking at this shot!  I will turn off light so I can fire the shot!
A beautiful center ! __eou__ That's a good way to shot it!  You have the best shot at the center for the shot!  !  It is war on the center, but we seem to have fun with this war of ours!
Mary , how was your date with John ? __eou__ I think it is going OK. It seems like we have a lot in common, but I can't say I love him. We have been through a lot together, and it seems like it was OK, but we did break up. We do have a LOT common though, like love, not to be loved, is something we have in common. I do like him though, so I think we are ok together, but not sure if I love you. I just think we have been together for a while, so maybe we will see what happens . It seems.
Mary , how was your date with John ? __eou__ I think it is going OK. It seems like we have a lot in common, but it seems like there seems to be common for there not to be a lot common for us. I think I will have to say goodbye to Mary now. I will let you go. Have a good one, and kiss you later . . .
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ All that really depends on the visiting team and how the game shapes up.  But it all depends on how much the other team is doing as well.  If the visitingteam is not to win the game they have to cancel it.  I think they are the only team that has had to cancel.  It has been the case before.  The other team has had it all right up until now. .
I hope the host team loses . __eou__ All of that depends on how the host team shapes up. The visiting team can also lose but I think it all depends on the other team too. I think the host is going to be helpful in how it shapes up, but the visiting team will have to be able to help out the host if necessary.
What do you think of the former champ ? __eou__ I think there were some, some good and some bad. The champ was so much better, he just lost too soon in his defence , which is why he lost it, so he was so bad. I think he misses defence is the problem, he is the champ, and he can defend and attack but he can never attack well enough, it is too bad. He misses defence in his attack.
What do you think of the former champ ? __eou__ I think there were some good and some bad.  He lost it all in 2016 in the first round , but he was so good in 2017 , so I think it was too bad he lost , but the champ can always defend his title.  I like how he misses defence so much now that he is out,  it is a cheer when he misses Defence and he is the champ.
Steve , when are you going back to America ? __eou__ Next week, next week, I think.  I am actually in Iran right now.  . . . but I am going to America in the next week.  It is not a new job for me in America, so I am not going to take it.
Steve , when are you going back to America ? __eou__ Next week, I am going to Iran next week, so I'm going next week. . . . I don't know. I think that the president is going to be president again, so not a new job for me.
I have really enjoyed your party , Lisa . __eou__ No, not at all, not with Sam at all. He seems to be in charge of his family and the party.  Sam, you're right, Sam, is the one who should be in Charge of the party, not me, not Sam, not him.  I am not in charge at all!  I'm the one that owns the family.
I have really enjoyed your party , Lisa . __eou__ No, not at all, not Sam at all.  What would Sam do for a party if he had to be in charge of a third person?  I would be in control of the party.  I have no idea what Sam is doing.  Thanks for all of it.
Are you still at that work ? __eou__ I am still at my job, but I am not working there right now.  I am going to go work there soon.  But, I really find my job there to be boring.  It really is.  You know, I would like to change my job because I think that work is boring. But it is the only way to make money so I am still working there.  So I would have to keep doing it, I think.  How about you?  What is your job job?  Do you like your job?
Are you still at that work ? __eou__ I am still at that work, but I am not working there as much as I used to be. I really find my job job to be boring, and I would like to change my job because I do not like working there. But, I am trying to learn how not to have a good time at that job and I really do not find it to be very boring. I would really like to work there and learn more about how to have fun there, so I would be willing to work at that new job job.
Can you tell which team seems to win ? __eou__ I'm not sure I can say I can, I would have to say that it is not really in our favor to say, but it sure seems like it is.  Now if I say that the score favor our team, it is in our Favor to say we lose when we score.  So, the score favors our team and we win when we have a penalty.  But if we score when we win with a penalty, then we lose with one.
Can you tell which team seems to win ? __eou__ No I can't say that I do.  I can say, though, that the score favor our team to say the least.  That is, the score is in our favor by 3-0, but that is to say, that we have the victory.  Now, the goal is 3-2 in our Favor.  So, if you want to be generous, the team has the victory by two.  But, it's still a 3-1 score.
we will miss you while you are studying in the United States . __eou__ Yes, I will miss you too , I will keep in touch with you , but I too will be in touch in the United States as well . I will try to keep up with all of you.  I will do something to play with you there.
we will miss you while you are studying in the United States . __eou__ Yes, I will miss you too! I will keep in touch and keep in the touch with you too, and I will burn with the burn of the badness of the United States if you do not come back. But I will smile and say I love you, I wish you all the best!
what is the score ? __eou__ It's a score of 3 to 0. Ukraine took the first lead by 3 at the end of the first half and took the lead by one by the end.  The Ukraine team lead end half with the score at 3 to 1.  Ukraine team's lead end first half score was 3 to zero.  They took 3 of the 4 points at the beginning of the second half to win 3 to one and the other 3 to 2.  But they still lose by 3.  What do you think about the score?
what is the score ? __eou__ Ukraine's team took the first lead by 3 by the end of the first half but then they were down by 2 to 1 at the end. The Ukraine team lead end half of the game by 4. Ukraine took the lead at the start of the second half and took it up to 3. It would be better not to have something like that in a game. You lose by 3. You can lose by 4 or by 1.
Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? __eou__ It is not , it is the same team, the Japanese one, but it is a deficit so the Japanese are not in it, so I am not sure if it is.  But the US team has a team that is trying to lose to the other team, so the US is not in a deficit right now ,
Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? __eou__ It is not , but it is a deficit, and the US team is trying to get out of it. The Japanese basketball team has never tried to lose by more than 3 points. The US basketball team would probably lose by 4 or 5 .
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ Absolutely.  They are going to get it right, but we'll have to see if we can get a new replacement for them soon.  You are right, they are 21-25 right now.  I don't think Phoenix is going to die out, but they are going for it.  It's going to take something to happen for a replacement.  We'll have a replacement soon enough for sure... .
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . __eou__ Absolutely.  You are right.  They are trying to get to a replacement for them and you are right about that.  Phoenix needs something to happen for them to get a replacement.  There was a replacement of 21 to 0.  I think that is the one they are looking for.  But, they need something to happened for them not to get there.  The abort mission was for 21 to 10, absolutely not for 86 to 50.
In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? __eou__ I have been doing well, I have been practising for 4 to 5 weeks now for the discus and I have not been able to throw for 5 weeks, so I have something to eat now and then, and I will try again next week, but it will be more than 5 weeks if I can do it!
In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? __eou__ I have been doing well, I have been practising it for about 5 weeks for it.  I have not been able to bowl for 3 weeks, so I have only been practise for 4 weeks now.  It was a catch.  5 weeks and 5 weeks.  . . . I am going to go out of my way not to throw a party for myself.
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ Yes.  Did you see him take his last and last dive on his last try to get his gold?  You know, the one he used to see if he was safe to try to stop himself from trying to dive.  You'd think he would drown if he had to dive again.  I wonder if they let him try it again. . . . if he could stop himself, would he still take his gold if he tried to dive?
I think he deserved his gold . __eou__ You see, he did not see that one. He did get his last one, his last dive.  If you get a gold like that you can't stop to see something after to wear it and to see if you like it.  I did not get to see that last one .  He did not want to wear his gold out on the dive.
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Hey, how are you?  I'm doing well, how much do you know about it ?  Nothing really, just not much. What do you think you are up to ?  I'll have to look into it.  Mike needs to get something to eat and I need to go eat something.
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Hello!  How are you?  What are you up to ?  I don't do much.  What do you do to get away from it all ?  Nothing much. I am Mike, and I need to get something to drink before I die so I can get some drink in me, much, much much too much.
Which team won ? __eou__ I don't know.  I congratulate them for it.  . .    I don't think that the Spur, as a team, is going to pull it off.   But, if they want to do something, they need to do it.
Which team won ? __eou__ The Spur.  I think it is safe to say that it is the Spur, the best team.  If you are the Spur you are going to pull for the Spur. . . . and if you break leg you are not going to break leg, so you have to pull it for the other team.

Yes, we got on the train on the way there and we got to the cabin and then we got off the train and I got so tired too and began to cry for the moment when we got out of the car.

But Owen was so tired it was very difficult for him to sleep and he made it very embarrassing. I think Owen is going to have a good time and be happy for
Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ Yes, I have.  Yes, I got there.  We got on the train there, but I am so tired.  My mother began to cry the moment we got on.  I think because we took the over-night train and the train noise made it very difficult for other people in the cabin next to us to sleep.  She was so tired and so tired that she began tocry. I know that is very embarrassing because it is not like a train to cry and you can't tell your mother your son's moment of crying because it was a very embarrassing moment and it was so sad for her.
Which team has won ? __eou__ Neither . . . The last game they both ended up in, but it was all even, so it was like two out of three all together.  The game was like a game where one team had something to lose and the other team had to lose something to no one, so they both lost.
Which team has won ? __eou__ Neither!  The game was a game that ended in a 2-2 in 1916.  One team would lose and the other would lose but it was noncompetitive.  The other team would probably lose by one or two points.  All in all, a 3-1 game.

Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? __eou__ The train is the better choice. it is a little faster, and a little less expensive , but it is not much more expensive to go to a different city, and it is also a little harder to stop at every stop. the bus is a better choice, but it seems like a difficult choice.. the train is just a little more available and faster, but the bus can stay in place in a city.

It was kind of an unnecessary expense, but I didn't think it was too much , and most of it was not something I would lose money on, but the whole expense was kind to me.

Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we have built up very good relationships with our suppliers . __eou__ We do have so many different suppliers and they all have different values so I think they all want the same quality, but we have to be careful about how we use them.  Quality has to be included because if you don't, you can lose money so I have to think about what we have in mind and how they will do with it.  How do you think you would do ?

How do you choose which companies to work with ? __eou__ I mean, there are lots of things to consider, but for me there are three things to choose from that I consider. One of those is the quality of the companies themselves. Quality and delivery times are as important as price to me, and we also have to take into consideration technical technical things like technical support and after-sales service companies with a good track record and a good price/quality track record.  But, if you feel like you can work closely with the companies, it is also important to look for companies that sell things to you for a lot of other things as well.  For example, we look for

Although, sometimes it scares me that the guy's experience guy's don't really know how to deep, and that's sometimes what scares me the most.  Judy, you like sex?

it is time to graduate and it is time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? __eou__ I think it is because we need to work.

How long has the company been in business ? __eou__ I believe it was founded in 1960 and over 40 years now - so over forty years! The original company - Davies Engineering - was founded by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester, UK, in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds, England in 1980. . . . The original Company was the only one not to be successful and to go into bankruptcy in the last few years. They closed down their Leeds workshop in 2015. The company is now known as the Davies Engineering, Leeds, UK.

Why A3 , why not A2 .

Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ Well, I think I have accumulated enough enough experience in a given job to have accumulated a much much larger and much more diversified company where I could make a solid enough income to make money doing it. But I do not do not think I would have done what I am doing now if I did not have a really nice job with a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear and it was possible for me to take on more and more different job chances to enrich and enrich my experience with a company that was very well- established. I was starting up a new job with the company and it seemed like a great
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ Well, I do not have to work in a well-established, well-respected company, so I do need to have more and more 'labour chances' chances to enrich and broaden my experience and really broaden and broaden enough experience to be able to take up more and much more challenging jobs.

We have had many of these moment problems time year round and we have to close down production.

Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? __eou__ I'm not quite sure.  They are still testing it right now.  I think it's just in use now. The software engineers are probably testing it out.  The software developers are not quite done with the stock yet.  . . . They are trying to make money off the stock and software development.  It's a way to make more money off of software development and not stock.

Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers . __eou__ I am glad that you are right, I am glad you are here to help us out, right?

I have just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ Well, under normal conditions, each printer head lasts about 5 or so prints per month and that is why each head lasts. But under average, it lasts about 3 or 4 prints per normal month , but that depends on the user and the printer. So the average printer under normal . . . conditions head copies user month copies, but if you need to go somewhere to erase the print head, you can get it at least once a month. But if you have to go away from your printer, you have a few seconds to go there to stop talk to somebody, so you can erase it, so the printer will not erase it
I have just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ Well, under normal conditions, each printer head lasts about 5 000 copies or so, but under average . . . conditions head copies user month on month, so it is likely that each head will be used only once a month under normal circumstances , but it depends on the user who uses the printer, but it is probably not necessary to go somewhere where the person needs to change the head every month or so .

Are you doing the job the way I suggested ? __eou__ No , I don't think so. I did not think I did it like you said.  I think that your method is the best.  You can do it any way you like.

Can you help me ? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up . __eou__ Yes, you are right, we have to look at it now!

OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . __eou__ What is the "running speed machine"?  Is that the machine where you run the machine until it is done, or is it the machine you have to die on?  Is it a machine you use to slow down or a machine that will die on you ?

Is the factory fully-automated ? __eou__ No, it is partially-automated but not completely, Our production process process is not. We use robots on the production line for most routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually by manually doing the work on the factory. We try to be thorough and try to use robots as much as possible because we want to be sure that the factory is not a failure. But it is a production system robots production line assembly jobs work together with humans in a very serious way so there is a lot of work that has to be done manually . . .

Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? __eou__ I would say that the pulp falls from a pulp box onto a paper machine and is then extracted onto the pulp machine where it is basically basically just a wire bed with large holes in it where most of the water is extracted and then the pulp is then turned into the first part of the paper machine which is the pulp box, the pulp part of a pulp machine by design.  If the pulp system were not to be productive, it would fail.  The pulp machine would fail because of a design flaw in the design.

Owl ! I have twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I do not think it is broken but it really hurts . __eou__ I have a ankle too, I think I will just sit here, I do not want to put any more than any pressure on it right here, but I do need to call the doctor here - I would think that would be a better way to call than to have the pressure company doctor come out and look at my ankle.

Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he is hurt his back . What shall we do ? __eou__ I think it would be better to just not let him move so he would not know. I will get him a first-aider. The first- aider is the one who would be first-aid. I would not want him to break his back on the ladder though. I mean, if it is not to be a ladder, I would think there would be a better way to get him to the first-Aider.

I will have to be a good listener, so that Marco can ask for help.
You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? __eou__ I mean, we produce our own household cleaning products - so it is not like they are all about detergents and such.  We use phosphate-free detergENTS and so on.  They are all phosphate- free , which minimises damage to the environment and the products.  I know that household cleaning companies want to be tidy and clean up to celebrate the environment so that they can do the best job for the environment.  But, if household cleaning Products detergent damage environment, then they are not the best products for the consumer.  So, we are not going to use them.

What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? __eou__ Well they are quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components in them so they need to be able to solve them in a way so they can get something done.  We need to check the metal casing of the machines regularly for any signs of corrosion or corrosion and also to make sure they are not worn down or worn down by the machines and we need to also check the brushes once a fortnight to make certain everything is properly aligned and that they are being used and to make it so that we can empty them if necessary.  It is also important to make make sure everything is in place and properly aligned so that it is

There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . we will have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . __eou__ Yes , but, the maintenance team is fully stretched and is not only dealing with their own problems but also the problems of the maintenance of the WW2 war, but also that of the other war, too. We do not have enough time or enough time to carry out any preventive maintenance so that there won't be repeat problems. We have to do something about that. I think it is better not to get it over with now.

I know, but the maintenance team is already fully stretched out and they have been dealing with problems like the flu, too, but I think the maintenance teams problems will be repeat itself because they do not have the time to carry out any preventive maintenance and then have to deal with it again, but also because of the maintenance Team's problems time maintenance is not available to carry it out because of a lot of other problems like this, like the Flu, but, I am not sure if it will be a repeat of this year's flu or not.  We do not want to get it over with because we
How often do you service the pump ? __eou__ I take very good care of this particular pump because it is a crucial part of our pump process.  We clean it out every week and check the pump and replace the gaskets and recalibrate the gauges and lubricate the parts and flush it through the pump each month.  It goes through a weekly fluid change at the end of every shift to check for leak and leak and to check and check if it is leaking at all.

What do you do if you find something that is not on your list ? __eou__ It really depends on what it is that is going on. If we have disconnected it, it might not be something that is not broken but because of a problem with the unit, we need to add number one to the list of jobs to do before we do it. If there is a problem, then we can repair it or replace it or something. But if it is not urgent, we can just do as many jobs as we can so we can get the service done. But then, of course, if it's something that's not urgent , we will make a note in the service unit's record record to carry out the

John has not turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? __eou__ I am afraid to say I do not.  We are very short-staffed at the moment.  Can you ask the shift supervisor of his team to ask one of his Tommy's hour replacement to do some overtime for us ?  Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we can find a replacement , but we are very very short -staffed here at the present moment. I do know this is not a prostitute.  I do think she is not to be controlling or trying not to die, but she is a prostitute, so it is not an option for her to die.  She is not going
John has not turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? __eou__ I am afraid to say I do not.  We are very short-staffed at the moment.  You can ask the shift supervisor, Tommy, to ask one of his team to do some overtime work for you if you need him, but I am afraid he is not available.  I think that at the moments shift supervisor team overtime Tommy's hour replacement is not possible.  So, I think we may have to stop shift for an hour or two until we find a replacement and change the shift.  Can you tell me who the replacement is , if you can?  Perhaps one of the shift supervisors can stand in
what is wrong with the photocopier ? __eou__ I think it has just run out of toner, and that's why there is no more toner.

I would hope to be part of something more than just a person on the outside looking in.  What do you think about the person on that outside lookingin' in?  What are your hopes for that person?  I know that it is not full time work but I hope it can at least start out that way.  You are looking for something part or full
Are you looking for part time or full time employment ? __eou__ Start out with part time and then I would like to try to go full time, but would like something part time to see how it goes and if it can develop into something full time and I would hope it can be done with the help of someone who knows the right people, and if not I can leave and go look for something else.  So, part time is the correct way to go.  I like part time work, and hope to be able to leave when I die and go fulltime when I am old enough to have a place to go to.  But, if it is something partTime hope something time

What do you think of our price ? __eou__ It has gone up up sharply in price, it has gone down and gone up sharply, and now it has come down again, I am not sure what it means.

Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I do not know what to do . __eou__ Look at the little icon in the bottom right icon corner of the bottom corner of your screen. If you press enter you will gain access to this program.  Is it just flashing or does it die?  If it dies you will have to press enter and then the program will die again in the corner of this screen, if not press enter again and it will die.  I am not sure what the icon is.

The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database . __eou__ I think that the file is too big. You will need to expand your memory system to try and get it down. If you have to close down all the file memory files you have open , then you will need a new system. If your system is too small, you can't remember how to open them all. And if your system gets too big, you will have to clean up mess. .. like if there were too many file memoryfiles in the system and you had to close it down, and then you had a big file of too big files .. you would have to reopen the system again and again and try to get
The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database . __eou__ I think that the file is too big. You will need to expand your computer's memory and you will need all the file memory files you could possibly need. First you have to open them all, then close them down and then reopen them , and then you can try to reopen them again .. but if the file size is too large, you will probably break computer. I think that computer can break if too big and you have too many open files , and the computer is too old and big. It is not to be helpful to break computer .
Is that a no-smoking sign ? __eou__ Yes it is.  As you know, you can leak out some of the materials we use in the materials that we use and there are certain highly-flammable ones so we have to have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory.  It is a no-smoking sign, and it is not on the door of the factory, but on the sign.  I think that is ok, though . . . As far as I know, there is no leak out, but I am not sure.  But, you know what else I know?  We have a no leak sign in the material policy factory
Is that a no-smoking sign ? __eou__ Yes.  It is.  You know, you have to be a good citizen to use the materials we use and to be able to have a sign like that.  As you know, some of the materials that we use are highly-flammable, so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory.  So, if you see a sign in the materials policy factory saying no smoking or review material, it is probably a no smoking sign.  I wonder why it is?  I mean, it's not like the materials can be used to make highly-flame-prone materials, so why not
I have been having problems getting onto the Internet . __eou__ Yes I have, have you checked out your connection settings and the connection settings for those problems? have you tried using your computer to try to be safe or have you just checked it out ?
I have been having problems getting onto the Internet . __eou__ You should have checked your "connection settings" ? Have you ever checked your own? I like to use my computer but I try not to play games on it because of spam.
Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? __eou__ Of course! When you hear the fire alarm, you hear that "fire alarm ringing noise" which is a very loud, continuous ringing noise, which is the fire exit alarm, of course. If you have a burn down house, you should go to the nearest fire exit or escape as quickly as possible. It is very safe to light match a fire with a light match and then run out of the house. It helps with the evacuation.

What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ I am quite active and quite energetic. I like to do things enthusiastically and enthusiastically, and I like a "I am doing things enthusiastically" approach. I do not like leaving things to chance and like to get things done right, and act enthusiastically when I am done. I kind of like to act "quite" and have a "quite". I do like to try to get the things things done, though. It takes me a while to get it done, and then I get behind, but I try to keep going.
What kind of personality do you think you have ? __eou__ I am quite active and quite energetic, but not quite energetic.  I do like to approach things enthusiastically and I do not like to die trying to get things done, but I do want to do things enthusiastically so I try to get half of the things done and the other half done.  It's kind of like trying to die an act of will to get something done. I like to do the "do what you can" approach.  Kind of like getting into things things and then doing it well.
Could you arrange an appointment with Mr . Smith ? __eou__ Yes, I would like to, but Mr. Smith is too full of his own money for that. I think he is full of it too.

Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? __eou__ You can borrow from a bank, but the gross interest rate from the bank will be something like 7 % , which is still still a little higher than the 3 % we can borrow at.  You can still consider the bank interest rate something like 30 % of the bank's gross interest, which is a little less than we are paying now.  With corporate corporate tax at 50 % and inflation at 7% , it would be something to consider.  But we are only paying 50 % on the gross tax and the other 50 % is on the interest on the bank.  So, the gross rate will be less than 3 %
Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? __eou__ Where on earth can we borrow from a bank?  I would say from a commercial bank ,  but there is still still the matter of corporate tax.  With corporate tax paying on all of these taxes , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % to 10 % and the bank's interest rate would be something close to that.  I think we will have to consider a bank interest rate something like 30 or 33 % or something like that. I would like to say that we can borrow from the bank at 3 % and we are only paying 50% of the interest on it ,  the bank is only paying on 50

This is a really large purchase for us to be able to pay off at one time if we lose election.  We have to pay it off by installment, so this is what we are living on now.

What exactly is the problem with the latest lot ? __eou__ Well the problem is that we are faced with the fact that a problem that is part of the problem of the consignment is unacceptable. We have a problem with the problem part consignment damage that occurred during the consigned care that was in your care and that is unacceptable to you. We assume that this problem is a problem part of something that was not the fault of the lot itself but rather the problem that the lots themselves had. We do not want this problem to be part ofSomething we are not sure of. We would like to think that the problem with this lot is the ignorance of the people who were in the lot.
What exactly is the problem with the latest lot ? __eou__ Well, the problem is that the problem was that the consignment was not taken in care of well enough and so the problem with that is not only a problem with the consigned but it is a problem that is part of the whole problem with your consignment.  We assume that the damage occurred during the consigning but was not in your care.  If the problem part consignment damage consignment care is too complex to try and fix it alone, the solution is to fail.  This is unacceptable.  It is a complex problem and we are having to say goodbye to the consignor.  So, we are
Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? __eou__ Well it is a little different than what you say but it doesn't sound like a bad idea, Mr. Han.  But I think that I have a few questions for you first and I like the idea Mr Joey questions you about Japan.  I like that idea, too.  It is a sound idea, to Mr Joey.  He is a good friend of Mr. Joey's and I am sure it would be better for him not to be a good friends with Mr. Japan. He would lose his job for sure.  If he is in Japan, he could lose it.  So he could just go there
Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? __eou__ I don't know, it is not a sound idea. It doesn't sound like it would help. But Mr. Joey is right.

China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__ Yes, it is a hard question, but I am not sure I am sure we have a right right answer to that question, and it's also a hard one to ask China. I think it is better for China to learn more about our economic policies and policies in the past to learn how they worked and to learn what they are not and how they are different from them. I also think that this may lead to us to ask a few questions about our own economic policies in a way that will lead us to a right answer. For example, our government employed numerous numerous economics and economics policies to stimulate economic changes to stimulate the rapid
China is now a member of world trade organization .

Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__ Yes, it is a hard question to ask a right answer but I am sure China has the right to ask question but I would like to ask questions to learn more about China to learn a lot about China.  China's economic changes will also spur us to ask the question if China will lead us to declare war on our own economy or not.  I think that the new situation entails some changes in our government which may lead us both to declare a war on ourselves and on China. In the past, our government has employed numerous numerous economics and economic policies to stimulate the rapid economic growth of China's economy and to stimulate Chinese domestic

Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__ Well, understanding the significance of the nuance and distinctions in the trade and foreign customs business practices is very important for any trader to be able to do well in the international market.  I believe that there are a many different ways to do business and a continual continual challenge for global trade and investment entrepreneurs not to make friends with the other party.  Despite the many many countries accession to the TO trade rules organization's members to trade and trade investment and trade frictions, many of these frictions are still predominant among existing existing members of the trade rules and under the existing trade rules organisation's settlement mechanism.  However, I think that

How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? __eou__ That is a lot of money to get to sell for them, and a lot for them to sell them at that.

What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ? __eou__ I just think that the role of a teacher is to be in control of the students and not just let them take initiative.

I do not know how much of a candidate this is but I would think that the candidate would not want to be late to work.

This is why it is usually a very important time to explain that the candidate will be late to a Job interviewer and that he will be very late to the interview.

what is your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical nine to five job day, so a little longer than a typical 9 to nine and five is a little bit longer than the typical day at my job. Actually, I have been on most of my job days, but I have to work out of my home to be punctual, so most days it is nine to nine.  Actually, it is five to five, so I am on a little less than a 9 to five day, but still, I do have to be on time, so it is a good day to be able to work.  I don't want to be bore on my day
what is your working day like ? __eou__ I have a typical nine to five job day, so a little longer than a typical 9 to five day job . Actually, I have a lot of job days that are 9 to 5, but I work out of the office.

Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? __eou__ No , but I can tell you what the unit price is for a carpet here, which is the price on the catalogue price list.  It is the catalogue's price list and the price list goes up every year.  You can have a look at it here.  We also have many other kinds of carpets too.  I am in low spirits right now because of the increase in the price.  This seems like a way to pay for a lot of low spirits.  Here, the catalogue prices are going up and up.  But you have to pay more for the best carpets here.
Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? __eou__ No I can't tell you the unit price here, but the best way to tell is to look at the catalogue price list and look at all the different kinds of carpets on it, and to pay the price from that list. You can also see if you have to make money off it, you can pay more than the catalogue list price. We also have many other kinds of catalogue price lists here here, as well. I think it is the same way. I would say that most of the catalogue prices are just for catalogue and not for unit price .

I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? __eou__ I will pay for them, of course. It is my pleasure.  We will quote you the lowest price possible and you will add number one to the quote.  It is the prevailing way to make money on these patterns, so it is the best way to do it.  I can pay for my pleasure price if it is my lowest, but if it isn't, it is not my pleasure and it would not be my price.  You can add number 1 to the price and we will pay you for it, but it is still my pleasure, so I will not pay you more than the lowest prevailing price.

We will get you the lowest price we can get and then you will pay that price, it is the prevailing price for my pleasure price . I have seen the patterns and think they are quite good, and I think you can get a high price for them, but I am in low spirits and don't want to pay more than I have to, so we will get the lowest one we can , and you can pay the prevailing one.  Thanks ,
I have just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . __eou__ I am glad you like them! I am glad that you like it. I do like them as well. I have been to the showroom. Here on display on the show floor are all of the most popular and favorite silk display products that are made out of silk.  They are all the most most popular products on the display and are all made of silk of course.  Are you particularly interested in silk ? Or are you more interested in wine and silk display items?  What items are you particularly Interested in?  I am not sure I really like silk products but I am sure they can keep my attention.

We can offer you a 5 % discount . __eou__ Well, I would rather have you out of the price line offer, but your 5 % is too much higher than we expected and the price was much higher in the first place.  We cannot buy anything from you with your 5% offer because it is a failure.  But, you are right about the price. I would like to be a good person and try to be more than a 5 %, but we just can't do it .  So, you have to be willing to try again, but this time with a better price line Offer , and I think it is better.
We can offer you a 5 % discount . __eou__ Would you rather go out of your way to be a good person and buy something for less? I would rather go with your 5 % price line offer than a much higher price line Offer, which is much higher than we expected. We cannot lose sale because we have a 5 % loss, rather than a 10 % loss . We will not be able to buy the product if you do not buy it.
we are considering of ordering 200 computers , but I am wondering about the price you will possibly offer . __eou__ Oh my goodness! I will be more than willing to pay $5000 for the computer but the price will not be less than $ 1700, that is the price I am looking for.  I would not be willing to lose money on the computers just for 5000 like you said, but I am not sure what the price for the other computers will be.  Thank you for your help!
we are considering of ordering 200 computers , but I am wondering about the price you will possibly offer . __eou__ The price will have to be less than the 5000 $ price but I do not know what the price will be, but it will be less of a price than the $ 5000 $ you will pay here. I think they will drop price to less than $200 or something like that.  Do you think that will be possible?  I am not sure if you can drop price at all.
We are interested in your pure silk , but I am wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ? __eou__ That is right!  It is $ 120 per yard for sure.  I have a 5 % per yard % discount on it and it would be $120 per yard, including the silk.  We will drop price to $100 per yard.  But, we are not going to have a good time getting the silk, we will plant seed.  It will be a 5% discount and then a 10%.  I will drop it to $50 per yard and then $30 per yard after that.  You are going to plant seed!
We are interested in your pure silk , but I am wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ? __eou__ I believe it is $ 120 per yard or $12 per yard for silk. I am not including the 5 % per yard % discount. That is a 5 % discount for grass.  I do not like grass, but I am sure we are going to have a good time with it . . . and a 120 $ per yard discount is not much at all.
we are thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there is one problem . __eou__ I am not sure what that is, but I would like to see that. I thought it was something we could do. I know that the negotiation went very very well with our last negotiation, and I think it went very well for us as well.  I wonder what we gain from the negotiation for the refrigerators though?  I would think there would be something to gain from that.
we are thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there is one problem . __eou__ I am not sure what that is, but I would like that!  I always thought we did that.  I think our last negotiation for a refrigerator went very very well for us as well, so we thought that we would win on that one.  Our negotiation went really well on the negotiation for the refrigerators though, so maybe something is going on with that ?
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , is not it ? __eou__ It is , it is!  We submitted two designs to one of our buyers, and one was the one with the mug indented to form a grip handle , and the other one had the handle indented into the form of a mug for the buyers.  They chose to use this one.  I wonder why ? If you are trying to sell something , why would you want to sell it with one of their designs ?  If you want a better handle , you can just use their designs buyers one mug grip one, or you can use one of ours, but I am not sure if they will be willing to sell one
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , is not it ? __eou__ It is , I submitted two designs to our buyers and they each chose one of these two designs, and one was the one with the indented indented form to form a grip for a coffee mug , but they chose this one.  Our buyers said, "This is one of our best designs, we have never tried this before" and they are right , this is the best designs buyers one mug grip one could have.  I have not had coffee in a while and I am sure I will spill it, not some caffeine.  It is not the best way to spill coffee, but it is a good way to get
I am ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ? __eou__ Yes , I can, I have not made such such arrangements with the factory yet , but I want to do that.  I would like to make sure to make such arrangements before making a commitment like that, to make it sure it is acceptable to the factory before making such a commitment to you.  So you can have the factory pay you for the commitment and you can break it if you need to, I will pay you, but I would rather not to be in control of the factory if I can help it.  Do you know how much you will pay?  I will be able to pay you . So I can

Can you do that ? __eou__ Yes , I can, I have not made such such arrangements with the factory yet , but I want to do that. I would like to do so before making any other arrangements with you. I want you to make sure that you make sure if it is acceptable to you before making such a commitment to the factory that you have to be a good worker in order to do it. So I would be able to do a factory commitment, I just need to write it down and then write it up and take it to the Factory.
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . __eou__ Is that right?  You're right.  I don't like to go into the details of the time but I think it's okay, so let's just let it go.  Let us just get it over with.  We know that we don't agree on anything, so it's just a matter of us not getting into the same details.  But, you're right, we do have our disagreements on some details. . . . and when we do get into those details, it's something that seems to repeat themselves all the time.
If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . __eou__ Is that right?  You're right.  I don't go into the details of each of those details much.  But I'll just let you know that it is.  Let's not go into it.  You know, I think it is ok to go into those details because it is something that each of us can see that is right. It is just that we can't see the same details about how the person got there or what time of the person they were there and what they were doing there.  So, let's just let that go.
Hi ! May I help you ? __eou__ You can help me!  I am very interested in your product corporation!  You know I am not familiar with your product company, but I am interested in you!  But I am sure your product Corporation has a lot of money!  How much money do you have ?  I don't know.  I can't tell you.  It's not my product corporation.
Hi ! May I help you ? __eou__ You can help me !  I am very interested in your product, I am really interested in you!  I know that I am not really familiar with your product corporation.  But I know what you are saying.  You are saying that your product Corporation has so much money that they can't clean up mess like the one that your corporation had.  I think that is a little much money.  How is this possible?
To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I would suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . __eou__ Yes , I will consider that. I think you have the same difficulty, but will consider it. I do think it is the possibility way L C goods June 1st will be delivered to you , but you will have to open up the L C Goods delivery to be delivered in June 2nd. I am not sure what I will do when it comes to that. By the way, I think it was a possibility that L C C had to open the delivery on June 1, but if I want the goods to be shipped in June , I think I need to be in charge of the delivery.
To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I would suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . __eou__ Yes , I will consider that. I will look into the possibility way L C goods June 18. I do know that I have difficulty, I will have to smile at the way you look at the possibility . By the way, I have to open the L C C goods to be delivered to you in June, if that is the way I want the goods to come to you , I am going to have to go to the LCCC office and let them know, but when I do , I have a difficulty. I am not sure who is going to be in charge of the LC C and who will be in control of

Is there anything that you are interested in ? __eou__ Hello.  Is there anything you'd like to do this, next, or next?  Is this your "new" product year or just this year?  I am not sure.  If it is a new product year, I want to celebrate it but I don't want to lose money on a noncrucial product.  What do you mean?  What is your new product?  Does it need anything new?  Anything to celebrate or do?
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Yes.  I think we have everything in the contract.  It's just we have a little important point about a last minute point. I think that we should include an arbitration clause in the agreement.  We have a contract but not a contract, it is a contract with an agreement, and I think it would be break even if we missed an important point.  So, we have an agreement for a one minute point arbitration clause and a one hour and 18 minute point contract with a arbitration clause.  If we miss a point, we will be break up.  But, I think the arbitration clause is not important.
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Yes.  I think we have everything in the contract.  It's just that we may have missed an important point at this point because the contract is too important to be understood by everyone.  We should include an arbitration clause in the Contract so that everyone knows everything.  There is a 15 minute point arbitration clause clause in a contract that allows for everything to be resolved at a certain point.  Do you have to sign a contract at a particular point?  I do not think we do.  So, we may be in for a few more minute point contract negotiations.  That's why we are at a 5 minute
What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? __eou__ We should do what we did with the first one.  I would either have to lodge a claim with the shipowner's insurance company or an airport.  One of the two things we would have to do is either do one of the other two things, or we would just have to try not to be successful with both.  The airport insurance company would have a bad review if they were not to succeed with their first claim.  That would be a bad news story for the ship Owner.  What would the airport insurance companies do?  Do you know if they would let the airport have a "bad review" or not
What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? __eou__ We should do one of the two things - either we have to lodge a claim with the shipowner's insurance company or we should do it on our own - either way, we should try not to be successful with the war of the things claim shipowner insurance company and get a bad review or a bad bad review from them - or we could do one or the other.
What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? __eou__ I have got a few, I have a computer engineer's certificate and a computer technician's qualification. I got both after graduation, so it is not a failure. I did not to get a degree in the first place, but I got a computer Engineer's certificate after graduation.

Excuse me , is this personnel division ? __eou__ Yes . . . What can I do for you? What do you want me to do? I can't help you if you can't say.  I think it is personnel.  What is something to do for them ?  I wonder if they have to close down.  They do not need more personnel.
Why do you want to be a tour guide ? __eou__ I like to travel, and I would like to be able to help people travel. I would also like to do it because I like meeting and getting to know various kinds of different people and seeing how they travel. But I also like that you can train others to do the same. I don't like to train people who are there not to help out but just to go on their trip. I think they are just all different kinds of people . . . all kinds people.
Why do you want to be a tour guide ? __eou__ I like to travel and I like to go on tour.  I also like to read guidebooks and I also think it would be like a way to meet people and get to know various kinds of people.  You know, there are so many different kinds of tour people you could die to meet.  Do you read guide books?  I like meeting various kinds people and going on tour with them and reading their books.

So, as a student, you will be in control of the school from now on.  But you will have to graduate at the end of this month.  Do you know how old the Shanghai finance trade school is?

I want to graduate from the Shanghai Finance Trade school and then China next month but I don't know if I can do that. I will just graduate from it.

May does not get along very well with her mother-in-law . __eou__ Yes.  That is just what she is known for.  She is not the best.  What is really troubling is that she is going to allow her baby to die and she will not help out.  John says she is just trying to do what she has to to get by.

It would be like a divorce in the lovesand, and it is inevitable.
What will happen to the children if you break up ? __eou__ I am not sure, but it is a little more of a relief misery for him and it is not a relief for me, and for him.  I am not a person who wants not to be a part of something that is a misery for the children.  It is a relief that the children will still go to school and be able to go to college.  So it is more of an a relief pain for the person than the children themselves.   I do not want them to go through that.  . . .

What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ If he was a programmer, he would have been a better boss!  He would have got to pay his boss Bob with stock options and a pay-to-play pay.  He wanted the pay, and Bob did not want to pay him.  But Bob did get a job with a game programmer and he was able to play that game again and again and he did well.  I think the game programmers get paid a lot of money for being programmers, but Bob did well because he was the best programmer.  And he got a job as a programmer. But he did not get the pay he wanted.  So
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ He wanted to get the pay from the boss.  He did not want to pay himself, he wanted to be able to play that game and be alive.  But his boss Bob was not going to pay him with stock options and he did not lose his job.  If he were alive, he would not want a programmer to lose his Job and have to play the game again and again and over and over, just to say goodbye to the boss, Bob.  I think he did get stock options though.  And he was a programmer.  You know, he said he would never play a game again.  So
How do you get paid ? If you do not mind my asking . __eou__ Well, I get cash, but if our cash launch launch goes well , I will get more.  But if it does not go well, I will have to pay off my stock options off and then we will get the money off.  I do not mind asking.  You have a big time for asking. You know the answer to that.  No, I do.  It is not the cash, just the stock options.  So, I think it is cash launch stock options time.  If it goes well, we will be done and I will be able to pay you the money.  Thanks for asking
How do you get paid ? If you do not mind my asking . __eou__ Well I don't know the answer.  I don's to get cash,  but I think if our "cash launch" goes well and it goes well ,  it will pay me off.  But,  I think my stock options will pay off as well.  We have a big time to go and I think it is a big way to acquire knowledge.  So, I would rather get cash for our cash launch stock options time and then get some cash at the end.  It is better not to be a part of something that is too big for me to own and I would much rather own the shares than

I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . __eou__ By no means do I mean she's in business, she just does it for herself.

Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? __eou__ No way!  I don't want to get in the way, but I think I might want to.  Plus, what if it was about Vince himself?  I mean, I don'd want him to be satisfied with the satisfaction of just squishing it.  This way satisfaction bug myself, too.  If it is about Vince, then I'd want to win.  I just want to be with him.  But this is just going to bug myself for a while...

Plus I have to smile and say sorry

How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made much simpler, and that the transport system bus routes could be much simpler.  I think it would be efficient to ship the bus routes across the ship in a straight line rather than going roughly in astraight line on the bus.  The bus routes seem to always seem to twist and turn rather than actually go where they are going.  That is why I never seem to know where the bus is going.
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made much simpler, that is, that it could be efficient enough that everyone could use it. The public transport bus routes could be simpler too. I mean, they seem to go roughly in a straight line but the routes seem to never know where the bus will actually go. It seems like they would need to twist and turn rather than going roughly in the same line. It could be possible to use computer computer algorithms to tell the bus routes to go in a certain way rather than just following a straight straight line like a bus would.

Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? __eou__ I did not. I did not hear about that, but I heard that they took both of the drivers to the hospital. One of them needed surgery.

I'm sure I did. I think that was the one who took the car that took both drivers to hospital. I would like to see the one of the driver's hospital surgery.

I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they are famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ I think that they must have it so much better than we do, but they also must get really sick of the horrible lives they have. They have to show up wherever they go and do whatever they want and have it all their way. All the while, the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they are, and they get sick of it. It's a public scene and they have to do what is right for them. I think that the show has been around since the 60s, but it's still a new public scene for them now . They must have to get used to all the attention.

What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I would say the main reason is that poverty causes wars. The military is the reason poverty Countries have to declare war and force their people to war and that is the main cause. People get frustrated because they have so little and they want to help their neighbors because they know their neighbors have some resources and they have no resources to help them , so they try to steal them by trying to steal from them by using military military force. But the reason Poverty Countries have war is because poverty causes them to declare War because they want their people not to be poor.
What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ I would say that the main reason we have war is because there is so much poverty in certain countries and the Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little and they want to do something to help their neighbors who have some resources , and they try to steal them by military force to force them into war, but I think the main cause of war is just poverty. If their neighbors don't have some of those resources , they try their best to steal it, and the military is willing to end up in war because they want their neighbors to get what they want . So, I would say the mainReason poverty Countries people neighbors

I cannot believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ It's not like it's a classic novel!  It is just a classic fact novel and not a novel about English.  It's also one of my favorite novels, so it's not that it is a novel of fact , it is just that it was a classic one and he used it to prove his point of a false assumption.  In fact, it was one of the classic fact novels he used as well to prove that he was right, so I think it was an interesting way to teach English!

Do you think children watch too much Tv ? __eou__ Only when I allow my child to watch tv.  I only allow him to watch TV for about an hour or so a day but only on TV and only if I can turn it off when I do not want to.  But I do think that TV is bad for kids and I think that kids should be able to be active and not become couch potatoes.  So, I think it is bad to allow tv to be too much of a part of the day for children.  And I think if I had to watch an hour of tv a day I would have to turn it up to at least 50% to get things

How do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ I think it is mainly from where the environment is, and it is how the person lives their own lives in it.

So, if you have a cd - rom, you can use it, but I do not think it will be useful for entertainment.

It is not an American tradition tradition for me to celebrate Thanksgiving but I do like it so much. I do not even really know what it is exactly that is being celebrated, really!
