And how many different applications are even available on the web. I know that the world is so wide and the internet can be so small. It's awesome. But it is not as wide as it used to be. How many applications on the internet are wide enough to have applications on it? And how narrow are wide applications that they close them? I think they are wide but they are so small that they are actually too small to use.

I can't believe that he did not know about it before he became the emperor

I don't like to be upset about anything.  If you die, you die and then you get a false sense of security, and then nothing.  It is just an ashtray.  Sorry about that.

When i saw it again, I felt the same way . I know the same thing.  I know what you mean.  Mary and I both know that there is something in there that will die with me if I do not like it.  It's not the same for me.  But, it is something.
Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? Well it is a little different than what you say but it doesn't sound like a bad idea, Mr. Han.  But I think that I have a few questions for you first and I like the idea Mr Joey questions you about Japan.  I like that idea, too.  It is a sound idea, to Mr Joey.  He is a good friend of Mr. Joey's and I am sure it would be better for him not to be a good friends with Mr. Japan. He would lose his job for sure.  If he is in Japan, he could lose it.  So he could just go there
Did you know the china wall was very large and famous in the world. No, I did not know that.  I think I may have seen a movie about that before.

I think one of them is on Netflix now that I know about actually.

Hello, let us talk about television. There have been a lot of pokemon episodes made, more then 750 total. That is so many! I wonder who has the time to do all of those. I wonder if there is a one who has enough time or enough time to watch all of them. In baseball there is one baseball team that has not to play a game or lose game for a year for 16 years or more and they go on to for straight! 50 of those.. 50 a year!
How do you feel about the TV series ? To be honest , I don't know what to say to be more frank. To be honest, I think that it is a waste of my time to watch it , but I think it is more about sheer waste of time than anything else. I think you need to be efficient with TV to be able to watch TV , but it is just too much to waste time on it. I just think that we need something that is more efficient to say goodbye to TV, and say goodbye and rewind it all over again.
Humans have come a long way, am I right? Yeah for sure. we became very modern, in terms of many aspects of our behavior and behavior and such, I think.  We became more modern in the terms of 50,000 years ago!  So, I would die not to be the best example of 50k ago! I would be a better person!  We have come a long way since 50,k years ago, for sure!  Do you die?
Do you like Oscar Wilde? DId you know that his last words were "my wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One or other of us has got to go." I do like Mr. Wilde. Some say that he was like the wallpaper.  :) :) :) I like Mr Wilde's wallpaper beast, a feisty, feistY, fey wallpaper beast :) I think Oscar was trying to be a good citizen, and he didn't retire.  So, if he had to die, he did it in the wallpaper?  I think he was trying, like they say, to be the best he could.  Some say he was the last to die.  I don't know about that.  What do you think ?:)
People in Indoenesia do not like crocodiles. They killed 300 after 1 killed a villager. You can see how that is. I can't see how. The crocodiles can be very dangerous though. for them, it is about their safety. People drown or drown to get safe from the crocodiles. It is not about human safety though. the crocodile is about how the human can die from the crocus.
Hello. Did you know there is a violin made of stone, and it is actually playable? I've heard of that.  Wonder if it is still in use if it's actually playable or not.  I wonder if it has all of the strings, like normal violins?  Or if it was made of something that would die if it got hit by something or something like that. It has 4 strings, just like normal Violins.
